# TinyML Enthusiast & ML/DL Practitioner 
I'm an undergrad student from Bangladesh, studying Mechatronics Engineering at Rajshahi University of Engineering & Technology (RUET). In addition to being focused on my studies, I have a keen interest in TinyML, Robotics, Data Analysis, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning.

Apart from these, I love literature, world cinema, songs, and cats.
